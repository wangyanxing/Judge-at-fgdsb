### Features

Judge@fgdsb is a desktop app that helps you to learn algorithms and practice real interview coding questions.

The app will call the local compilers or virtual machines to compile, run and judge your solutions.

We do support C++, Java, Ruby, Python and Lua. Scala supporting is on going!
